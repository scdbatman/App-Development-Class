# CodeChallenges
This repo contains code challenges for the Mobile Development program at Mountainland Technical College. The name of each code challenge corresponds to the day of the course it's associated with; for instance, SF13 is day 13 of Swift Fundamentals on the master schedule.

Each code challenge should be completed in-class, not ahead of time or after the fact. The value of these code challenges largely comes from:
- Helping you start each day with a simpler coding task to work on
- Giving you a chance to talk to your classmates about solutions
- Giving your instructor a chance to provide feedback on your solutions and teach you new tools that you may not encounter on your own

For these reasons, code challenges are only scored when completed in class. Since 85% attendance is required, 85% code challenge completion is the minimum as well.

## Students:
You should create a fork of this repository to work on completing each challenge. Forking it will allow you to make changes to your own copy of the repository without affecting the original. However, if changes are made to this source repository, you'll be able to merge those upstream changes to your fork as well.

## Instructors:
For the first weeks of class, send students code challenges manually over Slack. Once we cover Git/GitHub, we will walk them through:
1. Forking this repo
2. Commiting their already completed challenges for the first few weeks
3. Pushing their commits to their forked version

Please feel free to make changes and push to main for minor fixes like typos or rephrasings. For major changes, please open a PR.
