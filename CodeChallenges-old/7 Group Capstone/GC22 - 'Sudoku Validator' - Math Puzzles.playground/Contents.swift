//  üèîÔ∏è MTECH Code Challenge GC22: "Sudoku Validator"
//  Concept: Evaluating whole sets of data, not individual elements, to see if they meet criteria

//  Instructions:
    //  Create a function that takes an array as input. The input array contains nine arrays of Ints. Your function should return a Bool.
    //  In the input, each Int represents a cell of a sudoku grid, with each subarray representing a row.
    //  Write a sudoku validator. This function should return true if the 2D array represents a valid sudoku and false otherwise. To be a valid sudoku:
        //  Each row must have the digits from 1 to 9 exactly once.
        //  Each column must have the digits from 1 to 9 exactly once.
        //  Each 3x3 box must have the digits from 1 to 9 exactly once.

//  ‚å∫ Black Diamond Challenge:
    //  Look up some of the variations on Sudoku that change the board or rules (i.e., "main diagonals unique" requires that the main diagonals must be unique.) Implement new functions that handle these variant rules.
