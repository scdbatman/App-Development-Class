//  üèîÔ∏è MTECH Code Challenge PC24: "Numbers of Numbers"
//  Concept: Practice manipulating strings to implement unintuitive/potentially confusing logic

//  Instructions:
    //  Create a function which accepts an integer as input and returns a new integer.
    //  The new integer should be created based on the following rule:
    //  Replace each digit with the number of times the digit appears in the input.

//  Examples:
    //  Input: 136116
    //  Logic: 1 appears 3 times, 3 appears 1 time, 6 appears 2 times
    //  Replace each digit with the number of times it appears
    //  Output: 312332

//  Notes:
    //  Make sure to return an integer, not a string.

//  ‚å∫ Black Diamond Challenge:
    //  Make it so that your function also stores a log of all processed integers in the form of a dictionary, where the key is the input integer and the value is the output integer. Change your function so that, if an already processed integer is passed to it, it finds the correct output from the dictionary and returns that instead of reprocessing the input.
