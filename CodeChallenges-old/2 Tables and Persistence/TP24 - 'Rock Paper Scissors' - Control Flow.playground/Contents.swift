//  🏔️ MTECH Code Challenge TP24: "Rock Paper Scissors"
//  Concept: Practice writing functions with game logic

//  Instructions:
    //  Create a function that takes in two strings. The strings will be either "rock", "paper", or "scissors", with one input for each player respectively.
    //  Determine who wins, and return a string saying which player won.

//  Examples:
    //  Input: "scissors", "paper"
    //  Output: "Player 1 won!"

    //  Input: "scissors", "rock"
    //  Output: "Player 2 won!"
    
    //  Input: "paper", "paper"
    //  Output: "Draw!"
