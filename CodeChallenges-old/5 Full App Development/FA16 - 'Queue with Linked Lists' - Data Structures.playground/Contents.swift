//  üèîÔ∏è MTECH Code Challenge SD16: "Queue with Linked Lists"
//  Concept: Apply your learning on linked lists by implementing them to create a queue.

//  Instructions:
    //  Having your new found knowledge of linked lists and stacks. Implement a queue using a linked list.
        //  A queue is a First In First Out data type (FIFO).
        //  Think of a queue like waiting in line. When you are in a line you are added to the back of the queue. Whoever joined the line before everyone else will leave the line first.
        //  Queue will need a dequeue function which removes and returns the element that has been in the queue the longest.
        //  Queue will need a add function which will add an element to the linked list.

//  ‚å∫ Black Diamond Challenge:
    //  Try to implement the same functionality using a standard Array or Set. What are the advantages and disadvantages to creating a linked list manually? Write them in a comment.
