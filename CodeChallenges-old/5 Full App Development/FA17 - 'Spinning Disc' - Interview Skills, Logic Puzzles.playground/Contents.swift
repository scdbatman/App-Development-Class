//  üèîÔ∏è MTECH Code Challenge SD17: "Spinning Disc"
//  Concept: Many coding interviews ask candidates to solve some kind of puzzle on their feet as a way to test their ability to reason through a problem. This challenge is designed to practice your ability to think on your feet and reason out loud, instead of in code.

//  Instructions:
    //  A half black, half white disc ‚óê is spinning on a turn table. You have sensors available that can determine that the color underneath them has changed, but not what the new color is. How many sensors and where would you position them to determine the direction the disc is spinning.

//  Notes:
    //  You have 10 minutes to consider this challenge; you may use the space below to take notes on your reasoning or do math, but be prepared to explain your thinking out loud.
    //  You will share with a partner and then the class.

//  ‚å∫ Black Diamond Challenge:
    //  If there is extra time after sharing, you may then convert this challenge into Swift code below. Do not do so until you've had a chance to reason through it out loud.
