//  üèîÔ∏è MTECH Code Challenge ST02: "Profile Page"
//  Concept: Practice using SwiftUI view modifiers to style a view

//  Instructions:
    //  Below is a very basic structure for a profile view. You can view
    //  Using SwiftUI's built in view modifiers, improve the appearance of the profile page.
    //  No specific requirements for what it should look like are set so that you can flex your creativity, but you may want to try to use:
        //  .background, .font, .foregroundStyle, .padding, .border

//  Notes:
    //  Run the playground to see a preview. If you cannot see the preview, make sure Live View is enabled (Press Option + Command + Enter or, in the menu, click Editor -> Live View). Make sure "PlaygroundPage.current.setLiveView(ContentView())" is at the bottom of your code as well.

//  ‚å∫ Black Diamond Challenge:
    //  In addition to styling the existing Text objects, create other new objects befitting a social media profile page, such as Image, Button, or other views.

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("My Profile")
            
            Spacer()
            
            Text("Hi! My name is...")

            Spacer()
            
            Text("My interests are...")
            
            Spacer()
            
            Text("I really dislike...")
            
            Spacer()
        }
        .frame(width: 500, height: 700)
        .background(Color.cyan)
    }
}
