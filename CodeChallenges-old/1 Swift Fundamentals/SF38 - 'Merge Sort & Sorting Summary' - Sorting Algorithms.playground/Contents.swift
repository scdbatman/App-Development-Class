//  üèîÔ∏è MTECH Code Challenge SF38: "Merge Sort & Sorting Summary"
//  Concept: Review sorting algorithms and demonstrate a base level understanding of time complexity.

//  Instructions:
    //  Do some research on Merge Sort: üîóhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort
    //  Why is this sort more efficient than the other sorts we have learned?
    //  Why would we have you learn about sorting algorithms when there is a perfectly good .sort() function?
    //  Explain your answer in the /* */ comment marks below.

//  ‚å∫ Black Diamond Challenge:
    //  Include extra relevant information you learned in the black diamond challenges in your writing below.
    //  If you have not completed the other black diamond challenges, do those instead.

// MARK: Your response:

/*
 Merge Sorts are more efficient because...
 
 We need to learn about sorting algorithms so that...
 */
